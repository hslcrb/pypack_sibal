We take security seriously (as much as a prank package can). If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. 

Instead, please send an email to:
**rheehose@rheehose.com**

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- A proof of concept (PoC) if possible.
- Any suggestions for mitigation.

Please note that SIBAL intentionally creates a high-intensity environment (terminal flashing, loud noises). These are documented features and health warnings. Security reports regarding these intentional behaviors will be closed.
